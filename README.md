##AUTOMATED VACCINE SLOT NOTIFIER##

*The idea is to make an android application that will help users especially 
elderly people to notify them when vaccine slots are available at their 
given pin code. The application will ask users for their pin code, and will 
also ask for which dose they want to get notified for. Whenever the 
slots are available the application will play audio to notify the user that 
the vaccine is available at their Pin code.

*We are making this application to help elderly people, and also want to 
contribute to our nation's fight against COVID-19. This application will 
be a great help for people who are not much familiar with the 
technology or else they donâ€™t have dedicated time to watch out for 
slots. We will provide a very simple user interface that will take the 
hassle of finding out the slots.
